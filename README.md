I redeveloped a website based on the [Sahab website](https://www.sahab.ir/) to further enhance my web development skills. The project utilized the following tools and frameworks:

- Bootstrap: Ensuring a responsive, mobile-first design.
- jQuery: Facilitating DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Plyr.js: Handling custom video and audio playback controls.
- Swiper: Creating responsive and touch-friendly sliders.
- Font Awesome: Integrating scalable vector icons.


The website is fully responsive and supports both RTL (right-to-left) and LTR (left-to-right) text directions. This ensures accessibility and usability for a diverse audience. You can view a live demo of the project [here](https://parvin-noori.github.io/sahab).
